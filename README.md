 ## Fork of REST API of Where To? fur Deployment
 
 ## REST API for Where To?
 
 Built using Node, Express, MongoDB. Utilizes the Google Places API

## Where To?
 
https://www.where-to-app.com/ 

Have you ever been trying to plan a night out with your friends, but everyone is conflicted
on what to do? Or, maybe no one knows what to do and you need some ideas presented to you in
an organized format, which also match everyone's needs and wants?
 
That is what this website aims to solve! One person in the group selects how much you all want
to spend, and what you're interesting in doing (for example, dining). Afterwards, a link 
is generated where you and your friends can vote on a selection of venues generated from
Google's location API.
